Our approach leverages emotional intelligence principles to enhance the empathetic capabilities of conversational AI systems, particularly in sensitive mental health contexts.

- Multi-agent reinforcement learning
- Emotional intelligence in AI
- Mental health support systems
- Human-AI interaction
